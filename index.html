        <section id="Intro">
         <p>In the United States (US), the leading cause of injury related emergency room visits are fall related injuries. Balance function has been shown to be a good indicator of fall risk, with individuals that performed poorly on the Modified Romberg Test (MRT) of Standing Balance on Firm and Compliant Support Surfaces having a greater than 3 fold increase in the odds of falling. Higher levels of systemic inflammation are related to worsened function of the systems that govern balance function. However, no study has investigated the relationship between systemic inflammation and balance function.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="PURPOSE">
            <p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> To investigate whether C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, is significantly associated with balance function in the US adult population.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="METHODS">
            <p><strong>METHODS</strong>: A total of 2,040 participants from the 2021-2023 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included in this study (44.3 &plusmn; 13.2 years, female: 55.2 %). Systemic inflammation was defined as serum CRP levels measured using a two-reagent immunoturbidimetric system. Balance function was defined via the total number of trials passed on the MRT. The following covariates were included due to their potential effects on the relationship between systemic inflammation and balance function: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status (SES), alcohol consumption, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine whether CRP was significantly associated with balance function in the US adult population.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="RESULTS">
            <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Simple linear regression showed that CRP was significantly and inversely related to balance function (&beta; =-0.071, p&lt;0.001). After adjusting for covariates our multivariate linear regression indicated that CRP was significantly and inversely associated with balance function (standardized &beta; = -0.088, p &lt; 0.001). Other significant contributors to the model included age, education level, SES, BMI (all p &lt; 0.05).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="CONCLUSION">
            <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> We found that higher levels of CRP are associated with lower scores on the MRT. These findings suggest that higher systemic inflammation may contribute to increased fall risk in the US adult population. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
